This is a scientific project that analyzes data from a csv-file and provides information in the form of Python console output and plotting.
The csv-file contains data about bird species, their observation environment, dates of observation, and the number of observations.

Some terms that are used in the project:

1) Standard deviation is a measure of the spread or difference in data. When we talk about the standard deviation of the number of birds seen across all observations, we are looking at the spread of the number of birds in each individual observation from the average number of birds across all observations.

Let's say we have data on the number of birds seen over several days.
Standard deviation allows us to understand how much variation in the number of birds observed on different days differs from the average value of that number. If the standard deviation is high, it means the number of birds fluctuates greatly from day to day.
whereas a low standard deviation indicates a more stable number of birds during the observed period.

Thus, standard deviation allows us to assess the degree of variability in the data and can be useful in understanding the distribution of the number of birds seen over time or across different locations.

2) The mean, also known as the arithmetic mean, is a measure of central tendency in a set of numerical data. To calculate the average, sum all the values ​​in the set and then divide the resulting sum by the number of values.

3) The median is the value that divides an ordered set of data into two equal parts. In other words, it is the value that occupies a central position in an ordered series of data.

If the number of values ​​in a data set is odd, then the median is the value
located exactly in the middle after ordering the values ​​in ascending or descending order.

If the number of values ​​in the data set is even, then the median is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the two values ​​in the middle after ordering.

The median is more resistant to outliers than the arithmetic mean,
because it does not depend on values ​​that are at the edges of the data distribution.

The console displays information about the total number of observations, the number of unique bird species, and unique observation dates.
